# ocean-literacy-game
An interactive gamified web app to teach ocean literacy

To run the project we will use VS Code + Live Server:

Open the folder in VS Code.

Install the Live Server extension (by Ritwick Dey).

Right-click index.html → Click “Open with Live Server”.

Your default browser will open the site with a local server link.
